Evaluate student code based on correctness, partial correctness (like semi-correct logic or syntax errors), and effort (like pseudocode). 
Ignore variable naming, spacing, encoding errors (č, ć, š, đ), and unmentioned edge cases. Assign points (up to 10 total, with possible .5 increments) and provide feedback in Croatian in 2 sentence maximum for each task only. Do not provide general feedback.

Instructions:
Assign points for each task, ensuring the total doesn't exceed 10.
Use whole numbers or .5 increments for points.
